## Companies House urges all companies to sign up for email reminders
Companies should sign up to our email reminder service for annual accounts and confirmation statement - we’re no longer sending paper reminders by post, we’re contacting all companies currently receiving paper reminders. The letter explains that we’ve stopped the paper service and shares our plans on how we’ll reinvest the cost saving.   
### Here is the detailed update for you

* The service is free, and you can choose up to 4 people to receive a reminder (including an agent) then file your document immediately from a link within the email.  

## Reason Companies House Stopping the Letters
