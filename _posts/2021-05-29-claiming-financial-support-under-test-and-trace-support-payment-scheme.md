The £500 Test and Trace Support Payment is for people on low incomes who must self-isolate due to coronavirus (COVID-19). You may be eligible if you are employed or self-employed, cannot work from home, and will lose income as a result. You can only apply if you have been told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace, notified to self-isolate by the NHS COVID-19 app, or you are the parent or guardian of a child who has been told to self-isolate.

If you have been told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace, you are legally required to do so. If you’ve been notified by the NHS COVID-19 app to self-isolate and you apply for the Test and Trace Support Payment, you will be legally required to self-isolate.  

## Who can Apply?
You might be able to get a payment of £500 to support you during self-isolation if you live in England and meet all the following criteria:

* You are employed or self-employed
* You are unable to work from home and will lose income as a result of self-isolating
* You are currently receiving or are the partner of someone in the same household

If you are not on one of these benefits, you might still be able to apply for a £500 discretionary payment if all the following apply:
{:.text-red} 
* You meet all the other criteria listed above 
* You are on a low income
* You will face financial hardship as a result of self-isolating
