## Apply to the EU Settlement Scheme

If you are an EU, EEA, or Swiss citizen, you and your family can apply to the EU Settlement Scheme to continue living in the UK after 30 June 2021. You can also apply if you’re the family member of an eligible person from Northern Ireland.

You may be able to stay in the UK without applying - for example, if you’re an Irish citizen or already have indefinite leave to remain.

The deadline for applying is 30 June 2021. You must usually have started living in the UK by 31 December 2020.

The deadlines are different in some situations, for example, if:

* You are applying to join a close family member.
* The family member of a British citizen.
* You stop being exempt from immigration control It is free to apply to the scheme.

## Settled status

You will usually get settled status if you have lived in the UK for a continuous 5-year period (known as ‘continuous residence’)

## Pre-settled status

If you have not lived in the UK for 5 years in a row (known as ‘continuous residence’), you will usually get pre-settled status. You must have started living in the UK by 31 December 2020 unless you are applying as an existing close family member of an EU, EEA, or Swiss citizen who started living here by then. You can stay in the UK for a further 5 years from the date you get pre-settled status.

You can apply as a family member of an EU, EEA, or Swiss citizen if they started living in the UK by 31 December 2020.

You can apply if you have a family member who is an eligible person of Northern Ireland, whether you are an EU, EEA, or Swiss citizen or not.

### After you have applied

If your application is successful, a letter will be emailed to you confirming your settled or pre-settled status.

You cannot use the letter itself to prove your status.
