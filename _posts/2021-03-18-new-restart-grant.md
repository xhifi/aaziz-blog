![Protection if you can't pay your Commercial Rent](https://tinyurl.com/yfe8o6nq "Recovery Loan Scheme")  
## Protection if you can't pay your Commercial Rent
The government announced that commercial tenants who cannot pay their rent because of the Covid-19 outbreak will be protected from eviction.  
The government has extended its initial ban on business evictions multiple times and it is now due to end in June 2021. It says that businesses that can pay rent should continue to do so, as the ban is designed to protect businesses struggling the most.
### How do I get this support?
Commercial tenants and landlords are being encouraged to come to voluntary arrangements on repayment.  
Gov.uk makes it clear that this is protection from eviction if you cannot pay your commercial rent right now, because of the pandemic. It is not a rent holiday, and commercial tenants will still be liable for the rent.
