## New one-off £500 payment for WORKING HOUSEHOLDS receiving TAX CREDITS  

Find out more about the coronavirus (COVID-19) support 
scheme for working households receiving tax credits, 
your eligibility and how to tell us if your contact or bank 
details have changed.  
If you’re part of a working household that receives tax credits, you may be eligible for a new one-off payment of £500. The new payment is being introduced to provide extra support when the temporaryincrease in Working Tax Credit ends as planned on 5 April 2021.  
You do not need to apply for the new payment. HMRC will contact you 
by text message or letter in April to confirm you are eligible. You do not need to contact HMRC.  
This includes those who, on 2 March 2021, receive:
* Working Tax Credit payments
* Both Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit payments
* Child Tax Credit payments and are eligible for Working Tax Credit but do not get a payment because their income is too high.
