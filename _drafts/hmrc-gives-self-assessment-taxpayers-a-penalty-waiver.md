## HMRC gives Self-Assessment taxpayers a Penalty Waiver

**Late filing and late payment penalties are to be waived for one month for Self-Assessment taxpayers.**

The deadline to file a tax return is extended from 31st January 2022 to 28th February 2022.

**Penalty Waiver**

* Anyone who cannot file their return by the 31 January deadline will not receive a late filing penalty if they file online by 28 February
* Anyone who cannot pay their Self-Assessment tax by the 31 January deadline will not receive a late payment penalty if they pay their tax in full, or set up a Time to Pay arrangement, by 1 April

Interest will be payable from 1 February, as usual, so it is still better to pay on time if possible.

This year, like last year, HMRC is not charging late filing penalties for a month to help taxpayers and agents who are unable to meet the deadline. Late filing penalties will not be charged for online tax returns received by 28 February.
